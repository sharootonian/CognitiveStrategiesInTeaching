s75,4,7,7,7,1,I used my math skills by quickly deciding in my mind which path added up the most points and I chose that path for the student.
s76,1,7,7,1,1,I tired to make sure the path that I suggested even if the rest were 0 the combined the value of that one thing would be greater than the path previously taken.
s77,4,7,7,7,1,I calculated what was the current amount of points and tried to chose a path that increased it significantly

s95,2,5,7,3,1,Most points possible
s96,2,4,3,3,2,"At first I decided to highlight the largest numbered path, but after a few, I decided to look further up to see if showing path before that number made more sense."
s97,1,7,7,2,1,the path that would give the highest amount of points
s98,4,6,6,5,2,I looked as much as possible for a way to make one move higher than the one they took
s99,4,6,5,6,4,I just looked for the biggest number and saw if the path before it was more or less than what was already achieved by the student. I feel like I might have messed up a bit as I am always kind of more frazzled when on a timer.

s126,4,5,5,5,2,I looked at each row and tried to find where I could increase the score the most
s127,5,5,6,5,3,Looked at what path was taken and then looked if there was a higher point path that it seemed like the student had missed and tried to illuminate that.
s128,4,7,7,5,3,I always tried to guide the student from the very beginning to get more points. I only chose an edge towards the end if the beginning looked okay (if they were already getting a lot of points early on).

s160,3,5,5,4,1,teach the student to take the path of the most points.
s162,3,7,7,2,2,I added up the possible points and chose the one that would lead the student to the highest total. Most of that included looking to string multiple 3 points together
s163,3,6,6,2,1,Math
s164,5,7,6,6,3,I choose the best path that would yield points higher than the path the student initially took
s165,5,6,6,5,3,traversing the end points

s167,4,6,6,5,1,"I looked for options to maximize their potential but balancing that with guaranteed wins. Sometimes that meant not going for the most points because there wasn't a guarantee they'd be able to follow that path, but going for the best balance to increase their points"

s169,5,6,5,5,3,I wanted to show the connection between the two highest point yielding points.

s182,3,7,5,4,1,Try to get at least one 3
s183,1,7,7,1,1,Added up the points in each path and chose the one with most points

s190,2,7,4,3,1,I tried to reveal the path that I thought would be most likely to earn the student more points while also taking into consideration what paths they may not be aware of already.
s191,2,7,7,2,1,I tired to show the student the path with the highest point value
s192,6,4,6,5,3,I added up student last try and tried to improve on that
s193,5,7,6,4,2,Summed up the numbers in my head to pick the best ones.
s194,3,6,6,4,4,Choose a path that gives them a chance of going to a circle with higher points

s198,1,7,7,2,2,ensuring that the total points would be higher
s199,3,6,5,5,2,I tried to think about what they already knew based on the solid lines and then how I could increase their points by getting them to choose a different path or edge
s200,2,6,5,4,1,tried to complete a connection to the highest number
s203,4,4,4,4,4,
s204,3,6,6,3,1,I tried to reveal a path that was high up on the chart and worth more points than any other at that level
s205,4,7,5,5,2,Find the path that will produce the most points.
s206,4,6,6,6,4,I tried to select the path that would lead to a higher score for the student. 
s207,2,7,7,3,2,I choose the path that would earn the most points and at the same time was clear to the student which direction to take
s208,6,6,5,7,6,I tried to find the path that generated more points.
s209,2,6,6,2,2,scanning for the most points first
s210,3,5,5,3,4,"net points gained from different path (0 to 3 = 3, 0 to 2 = 2, 1 to 3 = 2, etc)"

s212,5,7,6,5,1,the path with the most points
s213,5,7,5,7,4,To find the simplest path that would lead to the biggest leap in points. 
s214,2,6,6,3,1,"Connect the two highest points; typically that would get them more points than taking a different route, regardless if they got 0 or 1 point(s) in a spot. "
s215,3,7,7,4,1,adding up the points the student had in the path and then focusing on getting teach them to get more
s216,5,5,5,6,2,"Start as strong as possible, with as many points as possible"
s217,1,7,5,2,1,I tried to pick the edge close to the bottom since most of the chart at the top you can already see.
s218,2,5,5,3,5,"at first connecting the most points, by the end looking at what makes sense for a student to have chosen and what missing information i think that they did not have"
s219,3,6,6,2,1,I plotted the value of a path and determined if it was possible to teach it by only highlighting one path
s220,2,6,7,1,1,I tried to pick the path between the two highest numbers
s221,4,6,6,3,1,Whichever appeared to give the most points
s222,5,7,6,5,1,"Looking at the path they took, then looking at which path could improve it. In some cases, it was lower down, in many it was choosing a different first path and either following the rest of their path they did, or that they'd be able to follow where the new suggestion would take them. In one case, I had to add what they had already done vs what I was going to suggest, because I was concerned picking a higher first path actually could end up giving them less points based on what options that gave them below. But I think the one I suggested still gave them one more point."
s223,5,5,6,6,2,ensuring incremental points each student (even if not max points)
s224,2,6,7,6,3,Looked at the path the student took then added up their points. then looked for other paths with higher points balances to suggest to the student 
s225,4,6,6,4,1,Choosing the path that gave at least more than the one taken by the student.
s226,4,7,5,4,2,I looked for the most obvious point addition
s227,2,6,5,6,1,to connect the most points

s236,5,5,6,4,2,Looked where the larger numbers were and tried to direct the path there
s237,5,6,6,4,2,connecting the lines to the highest number below to increase more points
s238,5,6,6,5,2,I always chose the path that would afford the student the most points.
s239,3,6,7,4,1,I tried to follow the student's path and then use a branching path that I assumed they saw at least part of and then clicked the better path that was attached to it.
s240,5,6,6,6,4,"Attempting their path and seeing if they should have approached it different initially. Otherwise, is if they are on the right track I will lead them to the next possible highest point."

s242,5,5,6,,3,Whatever makes more points
s243,2,6,6,3,1,I picked the route that would reward more points but built on what the student already knew.
