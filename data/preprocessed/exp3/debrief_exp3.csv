s86,5,6,5,6,1,I tend to suggest the top connections so they can start the path and hope the student made a good choice.
s87,5,7,5,4,4,I looked at what path they'd already taken.
s88,6,5,6,6,2,I looked at their original path and tried to see if there was one change that would give more points. 
s89,4,5,5,3,2,I tried to figure out which path would lead to the most possible amount of points.
s90,7,2,2,6,7,"It morphed. Mostly, when the student looked like they could not see the first big number, I'd direct them that way."
s91,4,7,4,5,2,"At first I revealed the path that would maximize the points, but about halfway through I switched strategies and paid more attention to whether or not they initially chose the higher number for their first path because that is my only real guarantee that I could get them more points"

s102,6,6,5,6,3,The higher number the better. If they had not chosen a path to a higher number I knew they could not see that edge and had to be taught it was there.

s129,4,7,7,4,1,I chose paths that would lead to the most points. 
s130,3,3,3,5,5,Edges that led to the most possible points
s131,5,7,6,5,1,I considered various paths and looked for the ones that would give the most overall points.

s138,6,5,5,6,3,I tried to identify why the student didn't choose the highest path and used that as a guide to what they couldn't see.
s139,4,7,6,4,1,I considered maximizing the amount of points I could gain with just one line added since I am unsure the path the student would take beyond that.

s151,5,6,5,6,4,if one line would give one more i would pick that
s152,6,5,5,5,3,"I favored guaranteed points whenever possible, opening a pathway I knew for sure the student could reach. If that wasn't possible, I tried to maximize the potential points they could gain by opening a certain path, *if* they knew the prerequisite path leading to it as well."
s153,6,5,4,7,1,I focused on the locations that the student had previously gone to decide why they didn't chose certain numbers
s154,1,4,6,2,1,I just chose the path that led to the largest amount of points
s155,4,6,5,4,2,I tried to find the ones with the most points they were unaware of

s162,4,6,6,5,4,"I tried to identify where the student clearly went down a path that wasn't optimal, and then chose the path that I think they were missing "
s163,1,6,6,2,4,I picked the line between the greatest increase in points and expected the student to reroute based on this information
s164,5,7,6,6,1,"The strategy that I used was to select the least complicated path to get more points. sometimes there was more than one correct path, but I strived to find the more straighforward path of the two."

s221,5,7,5,5,2,"I kind of flip-flopped between playing it safe and taking risks, but whenever there was  a risky edge to select that had many possible edges for the student to know coming out of it, I would usually pick that because the probability that the student would know one of the paths is favorable"
s222,3,6,5,4,2,I aimed for the most points.
s223,5,7,5,7,4,Connecting higher amounts of points.
s224,4,7,7,4,1,Seek out the +3
s225,3,6,5,4,1,"I tried to base the path choice on the highest value deviation from the existing path. There might be other options with higher points, but not knowing what paths the student's had access to, it was optimal to chose based on the knowledge I had based on their current options."
s226,7,7,7,6,6,I followed the big points circle
s227,3,6,6,7,1,I always tried to take the bath with a 3

s231,4,6,6,5,2,"It changed a couple of times, started with adding 1 point, then going towards the 3's then finally getting most points early on with a positive next level"

s249,5,4,4,5,4,I Just tried to visualize everything. 
s250,4,6,6,4,1,I tried to make sure there was a logical path to the +3 and then from the +3 to the highest numbers beyond.
s251,5,6,5,6,2,I chose safe point improvements (changing the last path to a larger number) when possible. Otherwise I chose a path that would possibly lead to more points depending on hidden paths they had above it.
s252,5,7,4,4,1,"I tried to guide the student to the points that would be the highest over what they had gotten in that same space before, but on a similar path usually. A lot of the time I couldn't know if the student would be able to take the path, but I had to bank on them being able to see the higher number I reveal and going with it."

s263,1,7,7,3,1,"I tried to choose the earliest path that provided the most opportunities later on. It made sense to me since the student could be ignorant of any of the existing paths, but choosing an earlier one sometimes gave them different options. I also chose paths that would be immediately appealing to the student if there were multiple possible early paths."
s264,5,7,5,5,5,I tried to make a judgement of the best path based on a multitude of factors

s293,5,7,6,7,2,To try and gain the student the most points possible
s294,7,6,5,6,3,I tried to see where the highest point values were and how I could teach the student to go down that path if there was a way for them to get there.
s295,7,6,4,7,4,I tried to see what choices the player made and if there were alternative choices at each step which would have given them more points.
s296,3,4,5,4,6,highest paying path.
s297,4,6,4,5,4,My strategy was at least guaranteeing a extra point

s316,3,7,4,5,1,"Just try to pivot the student towards a better choice. It may not always end up being the IDEAL choice, but it should get them at least 1 more point than they would have gotten had they stayed on their original path"

s318,1,6,7,2,1,To try and earn the most points for the student
s319,3,1,2,4,6,"I wasn't sure what I was doing, so I figured it out logically as I went, but still don't really understand. I think I did ok, though, based on my own understanding of the task's strategic aims. "
s320,5,6,5,6,2,I tried to total what they already had and check which path would increase that value.
s321,2,7,5,2,2,I showed them the path to the 3 point node most of the time.
s322,1,7,7,1,1,the most points
s323,2,7,6,5,1,I chose the path for the most points that the student didn't pick. When I had to choose one I initially showed the path that had the highest point total but towards the end I looked more at the beginning path the student took and sometimes started them on a better path.

s334,1,7,4,4,1,I just observed where the sum of the two highest nodes were located and continued from there. 
s335,2,4,6,2,1,what path would get the most points
s336,3,7,7,6,2,I tried to reveal the edge that could potentially add the largest amount to the student's total if they were paying attention. So my goal was to highlight the largest two numbers on the path that the student was not already aware of.
s337,6,5,4,6,2,"Tried to pick the path that would get the student an extra point than they had before, usually one of the bottom parts of the path so that I could be confident that they would be able to get there given whatever knowledge they already had."

s342,4,4,7,6,4,The one with the most connecting points
s343,2,6,7,7,2,I chose to provide them with a higher point option at some point in their route. I always tried to make sure my recommendation was based off the path they were already on.
s344,4,4,4,4,1,"I tried to predict the student's edges assuming that they did their best to get the highest amount of points. I then tried to strategically set them up to get higher points based on the edges I revealed. For example, showing an edge higher up on the map to allow them to hit higher numbers as they move down."

s451,5,6,5,5,1,I tried to either connect the path with the most points or lead a path to the most points if they were not directly connected.
s452,5,6,5,6,3,I chose the last path that had the most points if possible.
s453,5,7,6,4,1,Tried to look for guaranteed paths they'd missed.
s454,5,6,5,4,3,Choosing paths that added points while also not seeming like duplicate information

s468,6,3,4,7,5,I chose the path that was closest to the threes.
s469,4,6,6,5,2,I compared all of my options based on their value and then chose the ones that would equal the largest value altogther.
s470,2,6,7,2,1,I counted how many the student had and then I traced the possible paths that gave the most points on a line I chose to select.
s472,4,6,4,5,3,"Since there was information I couldn't know, I simply quickly added up the points for the best path and tried to steer them in that direction."
s473,5,7,5,7,5,I tried to pick things further down the path that could possibly imply taking certain paths earlier in the chain on the off-chance that those paths are available to the user.
s475,4,6,5,5,2,Divert toward highest points
s476,3,7,6,4,2,"I'm not sure of the strategy, I tried to think did at times did they not have a connection in the beginning"

s495,3,5,4,5,2,"At first I chose to unblock one path that would lead to maximum point gain. Then I realised that if I did that I might reveal a path that leads to nothing. So I decided to open a path that would at least get a higher number of points, not trying to maximize it."
